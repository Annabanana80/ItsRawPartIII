# ItsRawPartIII

My brand-new full-stack Gordon Ramsay recipe saver app. 

Made with MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and Node

Client side: run an npm install then npm start :)

Server side: Download MongoDB(if you don't already have it), make the db yours if you want-- 'sudo chown -R $(whoami) data/db', then run 'mongod' or 'mongosh' or whatever works for you, npm install, then run nodemon. 

Please enjoy and if there are any issues getting it up and running, please let me know. I will be deploying in a few days.
